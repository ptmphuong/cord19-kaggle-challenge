A beginner's attempt to extract <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COVID-19 Open Research Dataset</a> - a dataset of overly 52,000 scholarly articles about nCoV-19
and find out about the virus's incubation period using pandas and regex. 

Dataset downloaded on 4/3/2020

The writeup of the findings is posted on my blog post (written in Vietnamese): [What do covid-19 researchers have for the incubation period of covid-19?](https://tuihoccode.com/project/2020/04/07/cac-nha-nghien-cuu-nghi-gi-ve-thoi-ky-u-benh-cua-covid-19.html)
